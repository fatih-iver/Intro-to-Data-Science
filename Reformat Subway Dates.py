import datetime

def reformat_subway_dates(date):
    '''
    The dates in our subway data are formatted in the format month-day-year.
    The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-day.

    In order to join these two data sets together, we'll want the dates formatted
    the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
    data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.

    Hint:
    There are a couple of useful functions in the datetime library that will
    help on this assignment, called strptime and strftime.
    More info can be seen here and further in the documentation section:
    http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime
    '''
    date = date.split('-')
    date_formatted = '20' + date[2] + '-' + date[0] + '-' + date[1] # your code here
    return date_formatted
